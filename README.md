## “What Can I Cook?” Ingredient-Based Meal Finder

A simple meal recommender based on ingredients a user already has at home.

Business Requirements
- Users must be able to maintain a list of ingredients they currently have.
- The app should recommend meals where the user has most of the necessary ingredients.
- Each recommendation must display:
    - Missing ingredients
    - Percentage match
    - Recipe thumbnail + title
- Clicking a meal shows the full recipe and instructions.
    - Users can add missing ingredients to a “Shopping List.”
- Users can filter results by category (e.g., Beef, Seafood) or region.
